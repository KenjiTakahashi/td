**td** is a non-offensive, per project ToDo manager.

Heavily inspired by [devtodo][devtodo], but with some nasty features, like:
* Shorter commands for most used actions.
* Sorting/Filtering specific levels only.
* Persistent sort/filter/view options.
* Written in pure Python (it even has docstrings!)
* Tests (**place travis here**).

Oh, and it will automagically pick up your existing [devtodo][devtodo] lists!
